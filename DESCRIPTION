Description: Access to large host-parasite data is often hampered by the 
  availability of data and difficulty in obtaining it in a programmatic way
  to encourage analyses. 'helminthR' provides a programmatic interface to the 
  London Natural History Museum's host-parasite database, one of the largest 
  host-parasite databases existing currently <https://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curation/scientific-resources/taxonomy-systematics/host-parasites/>. The package allows the user
  to query by host species, parasite species, and geographic location.
