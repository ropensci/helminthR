### Installation

From GitHub

```{r eval=FALSE}

# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rOpenSci/helminthR")
library("helminthR")

```

From CRAN

```{r eval=FALSE}

install.packages("helminthR")

```



### Main functions

#### `findHost()`

Given a host genus and (optionally) species and location, this function returns all host-parasite associations of a given host species. The example below determines all parasite records for helminth infections of _Gorilla gorilla_.

```{r eval=FALSE}

gorillaParasites <- findHost('Gorilla', 'gorilla')
head(gorillaParasites)

```

#### `findParasite()`

Given a helminth parasite genus (and optionally species, and location), this function returns a list of host-parasite records for that parasite. In the example below, I query the database for occurrences of the genus _Strongyloides_.

```{r eval=FALSE}

strongHosts <- findParasite(genus='Strongyloides')
str(strongHosts)

```



### `data(locations)` and `findLocation()`

A data file containing all the location names that can be queried, along with putative latitude and longitude coordinates for the centroid of each location can be found in `data(locations)`. Note that this will replace any object in the global environment named `locations`. These names can be given to the `findLocation()` function, which finds all host-parasite associations that have occurred in the given location. Below, I look at host-parasite associations recorded in France.


```{r eval=FALSE}

FrenchHostPars <- findLocation(location='France')
str(FrenchHostPars)

```
