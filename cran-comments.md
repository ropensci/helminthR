## Test environments

- {os: macos-latest,   r: 'release'}
- {os: windows-latest, r: 'release'}
- {os: windows-latest, r: '4.1'}
- {os: ubuntu-latest,  r: 'devel', http-user-agent: 'release'}
- {os: ubuntu-latest,  r: 'release'}


All the examples are wrapped in \donttest{} calls as these calls access a web resource and sometimes this takes longer than the 5 second threshold.
